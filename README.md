# Overview

For the past two weeks I have been learning Pandas a data analysis library in python.

Data Sets:

I am using two datasets stock prices for google and stock prices for tesla. I obtained the data on Kaggle. 

[Tesla Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rpaguirre/tesla-stock-price)

[Google Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/varpit94/google-stock-data)

The data sets were similar having the same data "Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", "Adj Close". 
This allowed me to compare them easily.

Purpose:

I wrote this software to analyze data because I have been interested in investing and wanted to see if I could answer questions about these two common stocks.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

I was able to answer two questions with the analysis that i did.

First: What stock was traded more frequently and by how much?

The answer to that was Tesla was traded in much larger volumes on average than Google. Run the code to see the amount!

Second: How much money would I have had in 2017 (end of dataset) if I invested in Tesla in 2010 (start of the dataset)?

If my math is correct then I would have been able to increase my money by about 10x if i had invested in Tesla. You can check how much you would have made for any amount by running the code.

# Future Work

* Allow user to enter any stock data that follows the format (Date", "Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume", "Adj Close")
* Fix the output in tkinter window
* Get updated data and repeat analysis to find out how much money I would have today
